### `fetch.py`

Implements `sysforge fetch` — download one or more PKGBUILDs into `pkgbuild_src_dir` without building. Uses `find_pkgbuild` (auto-clones via `pkgctl_checkout` or `aur_clone` if not already present), then routes each already-cloned dir through `get_scheduler().request(SyncRequest(...))` for the shallow-fetch path (skipped with `--no-update`). `--force-fetch` sets `force_fetch=True` on the request, bypassing the RPC short-circuit for callers that want a guaranteed network check (e.g. to pick up a force-push that predates the cached RPC `last_modified`). Prints the resulting PKGBUILD directory path for each package. Exits 1 if any package failed.

Public API: `cmd_fetch(args)`.
