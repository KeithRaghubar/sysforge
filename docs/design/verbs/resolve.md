### `resolve.py`

Implements `sysforge resolve` — inspect profile matching for a PKGBUILD without building it. Output goes to stdout.

Two modes:
- **Profile resolution** (default) — shows which profile and flags would apply to a package.
- **Dependency resolution** (`--deps`) — shows the full transitive dependency tree with build order. Displays AUR vs repo classification for each dep and marks already-installed packages. Dry-run only — does not build or install anything.

Public API: `cmd_resolve(args)`. Uses `find_pkgbuild` from `config.py` for PKGBUILD lookup (same search order as `sysforge build`). Internal helpers:
- `_get_profile_chain(profile_name, profiles)` — walks the `extends` chain and returns it root-last; stops on cycle or missing parent
- `_find_winner(matched_rules)` — returns the highest-priority rule that specifies a `profile` key
- `_format_conditions(rule)` — compact single-line summary of match conditions, omitting `profile`/`priority`
- `_print_resolve(...)` — formats and prints the resolve summary: package name, PKGBUILD path, all matched rules with winner marker, profile chain (`→` separated), build mode (if set), consumes, groups; with `--show-flags` expands the full resolved flag set with sysforge-internal keys separated under a comment
