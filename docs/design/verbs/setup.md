### `setup_cmd.py`

Implements `sysforge setup` — one-shot pre-flight that stops `pacman -Syu` from silently clobbering sysforge-built packages with upstream repo binaries. It inspects `/etc/pacman.conf` for `IgnoreGroup = sf-build` and, if missing, offers to add it (interactive prompt). Packages built by sysforge carry the `sf-build` group, so the IgnoreGroup line gates the whole rebuild surface behind a single policy knob rather than requiring a per-package `IgnorePkg`.

Public API: `cmd_setup(args)`. Flag: `--pacman-conf PATH` (default `/etc/pacman.conf`) for VM or chroot runs where the file lives elsewhere. No effect if the line is already present. Intended to be run once after first installing sysforge; safe to re-run.
