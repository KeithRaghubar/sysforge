# SysForge Roadmap

Planned features and changes. This is the single tracked home for
forward-looking work; **`DESIGN.md` describes only implemented design** and
never carries roadmap IDs.

**Purposely-excluded and abandoned ideas live in
[`docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md`](docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md)**, together with their
rationale and reopen conditions. That file is history rather than backlog, but
its IDs remain part of this file's ID namespace — see `## ID scheme`.

**Shipped work is not recorded here** — it lives in `docs/release-notes/` and git
history (the commit that lands an item is its record).

## ID scheme

IDs are `<version>-<TYPE><n>`, e.g. `1.2.0-F1` (feature), `1.2.0-B1` (bug),
`1.2.0-Q1` (open question), `1.2.0-STD1` (standards), `1.2.0-DOC1` (user-facing
documentation), `1.2.0-DEV1` (contributor-only work). The version prefix is the
current `pyproject.toml` version. The per-type counter **resets to 1 only on a
major or minor version bump** (`X.Y.Z` → `(X+1).0.0` / `X.(Y+1).0`), never on a
patch bump — i.e. the counter is scoped to the minor-release cycle and stays
monotonic across patch releases within it. The version prefix keeps IDs globally
unique and records the cycle an item originated in. An item still open at release
time keeps its existing ID
(it records the cycle the item originated in, not its target). IDs appear only here,
in `docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md`, and in release notes.

**Those three files are one ID namespace.** An abandoned ID stays spent — it is
never reissued — so `make next-id` reads all three, and `make check-standards`
rejects an ID listed both here and in `docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md`.

**Never hand-pick an ID — derive it.** The open items above keep their origin-cycle
prefixes, so eyeballing a neighbour gives the wrong cycle (and the wrong counter)
right after a release. Run `make next-id TYPE=F` (or `B`/`DEV`/`DOC`/`Q`/`STD`) — it reads the
current `pyproject.toml` version, scopes to that cycle's counter, and prints the next
free ID (e.g. `2.4.0-F1`). `make check-standards` also flags collisions and
active-cycle sequence gaps.

Within each subsection, entries are kept in **ascending ID order** (by type
counter, then version) — sort on every add so the list stays scannable. Every
entry opens `- **`<ID>` — <title sentence>.**` and is separated from its
neighbour by a `---` rule, so a single item is readable on its own rather than
running into the next one. `docs/release-notes/` entries use the same two rules.

**`DOC` covers user-facing documentation only** — guides under `docs/guides/`, concept
pages under `docs/concepts/`, `README.md`, the man page — so doc work stays visible in release notes without
being forced into `F` or `B`. A `DOC` entry always lands under `## Changed`: the
section drives the derived SemVer bump, and documentation changes no API (a
`DOC` under `## Added` would demand a minor release). `make check-standards`
enforces this. Internal docs (`docs/design/`, `CLAUDE.md`, this file) get no ID,
and wrong `--help`/man output is a `B`, since it is CLI behaviour.

**`DEV` covers contributor-only work** — a fix or feature that touches only
`tests/`, `tools/`, the `Makefile`, `.claude/` or dev-only docs (`tools/vm/README.md`
and the like). Anything under `sysforge/` or a shipped file stays `B`/`F` even when a
dev problem prompted it, and changing a *rule* (a standards row, a process
convention) stays `STD`. A `DEV` item files its release-note entry under
`## Changed` only, like `DOC`: it changes no API, and the section drives the derived
SemVer bump, so it may only ever imply a patch (`3.4.0-STD1`; until then `DEV` filed
no entry, and those items' squash-commit subjects remain their only record, which
`make next-id` and the gap check still read). `make check-standards` rejects a
`DEV`-filed entry under any other section.

**Open questions (`Q`) must be resolved before any implementation.** A `Q`
entry is undecided by definition; investigation/spikes to inform the decision
are fine, but before writing production code the question must first be either
**promoted** to a proper `F`/`B`/`STD`/`DOC`/`DEV` entry (which then follows the normal
landing flow) or moved to `docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md` with a rationale. Never
implement straight off a `Q`.

## Priority, effort & bump tags

Every **Planned** entry ends with a machine-readable tag of the form
`*Priority: <level> · Effort: <size> · Bump: <kind>* — <rationale>`:

- **Priority** ∈ `low` / `med` / `high` — impact *within this backlog*. The backlog
  is polish by construction (anything correctness-bearing is implemented, not parked),
  so judge relatively: `low` = cosmetic/churn/latent; `med` = observability, or a gap
  that is *currently active* on a real system; `high` = user-visible friction now.
- **Effort** ∈ `small` / `medium` / `large` — implementation cost, independent of
  priority. On a uniformly-low-impact backlog this is often the deciding axis
  (cheapest-to-land first). Effort is stable; it does not decay the way a per-host
  "is this live right now" flag would, which is why urgency folds into *priority*
  rather than a separate tag.
- **Bump** ∈ `patch` / `minor` / `major` — the SemVer impact the entry will carry
  when it lands (standards row 3). `major` means it changes or removes an
  existing contract and can therefore only ship in an `X.0.0` release; `minor`
  is purely additive; `patch` is a fix or an internal change with no surface
  effect. This is **planning-time** advice: an item is removed from ROADMAP by
  the commit that lands it, so by release time the authoritative record is the
  release-notes accumulator, from which `make next-bump` derives the required
  bump.

`docs/ROADMAP-ABANDONED.md` entries carry no tag — the tag is planning advice,
and an abandoned item has no landing to plan. The summary table below is **generated** from these
tags — run `make roadmap-table` after any add/remove/retag; `make check-roadmap-table`
(wired into `pre-release`) fails if the committed table has drifted.

The committed table is always in triage order (priority, then effort, then ID).
To read the backlog along another axis without touching the file, use `make
roadmap-view SORT=<triage|id|item|priority|effort|bump>` (add `REVERSE=1` to
flip it) — e.g. `SORT=effort` for cheapest-to-land first. That view is
read-only by construction, so it can never be committed in place of the
canonical ordering.

### Features

### Bugs

- **`3.5.0-B138` — a verb that fails before installing anything leaves a stale sentinel.**
  `verbs.runner.run_verb` wraps all of a `requires_sentinel` verb's `execute` in
  `stage_sentinel.sentinel_scope`, which keeps the record on any exception. So `sysforge build`
  failing on a missing `pkgctl` (a `RuntimeError` raised before any install) leaves
  `stage = "build"` behind, and the next run refuses to start ("Stale stage-in-progress sentinel
  present"): a recovery prompt at a terminal, a hard stop for a timer or cron run. Found by the
  demo-recording container on 2026-10-23. Two shapes to choose between: arm the sentinel at the
  first mutation (the install) rather than at `execute` entry, or move pre-mutation checks such
  as the `pkgctl` probe into `pre_check`, which runs before the scope opens. The first fixes the
  class; the second only the cases found so far. The regression test exists: the end-to-end
  scenario `tools/e2e/scenarios/40-pre-install-failure.sh`, marked `xfail` until the fix removes
  the marker (`make e2e SCENARIO=pre-install`).
  *Priority: med · Effort: medium · Bump: patch* — blocks unattended runs after an ordinary,
  harmless failure.

### Developer tooling

- **`3.5.0-DEV22` — a terminal model for the progress bar's cursor handling.** `3.5.0-B132` and
  `B133` lived in real terminal behaviour, which the unit suite never sees: a cursor restored to the
  wrong row, a scroll under a saved cursor. The end-to-end tier (`make e2e`) runs on a
  pseudo-terminal but asserts on state, not on the screen. Add a test helper that replays the
  progress bar's output through a terminal model and asserts where the cursor ends up, under both
  xterm's and xterm.js's saved-cursor rules, which would have caught both bugs in the unit suite.
  *Priority: med · Effort: medium · Bump: patch* — the one bug class the end-to-end tier leaves
  uncovered.
